## üîß Technical Details

### Neural Network Architecture
```python
class WarhammerAI(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(50, 256)   # Input layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)  # Hidden layer
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 15)   # Output layer (15 actions)
```

### State Representation (50 features)
- **Empire units** (25 features): Position, health, capabilities
- **Orc units** (25 features): Position, health, capabilities
- **Normalized values** for consistent AI input

### Training History
- **600,000 total games** (300k per faction)
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration** with decay
- **Experience replay** with target networks
- **Specialized training** for different tactical styles

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Customization

### Adding New Units
```python
# In warhammer_battle_core.py
UNIT_PROFILES["New Unit"] = UnitProfile(
    name="New Unit",
    unit_type=UnitType.INFANTRY,
    faction=Faction.EMPIRE,
    # ... stats ...
)
```

### Modifying AI Behavior
```python
# In warhammer_web_visualizer.py
class AICommander:
    def __init__(self, faction, model_path):
        self.epsilon = 0.0  # Change for exploration
        # ... load model ...
```

### Custom Battle Scenarios
```python
# In VisualBattleSimulator.setup_initial_battle()
# Modify unit positions and army compositions
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Port 5001 already in use"
```bash
# Kill existing processes
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9

# Or change port in warhammer_web_visualizer.py
socketio.run(app, port=5002)
```

#### "AI models not found"
```bash
# Use the launcher to train quick models
python launch_warhammer_visualizer.py

# Or manually link existing models
ln -sf your_empire_model.pth empire_ai_300k.pth
ln -sf your_orc_model.pth orc_ai_300k.pth
```

#### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install flask flask-socketio torch numpy
```

### Performance Tips
- **Close other browser tabs** for smoother animation
- **Use Chrome/Firefox** for best WebSocket performance
- **Reduce battle speed** by increasing sleep time in the code

## üìä Battle Statistics

### Typical Battle Metrics
- **Battle Duration**: 10-25 turns
- **Unit Survival**: 60-80% casualty rates
- **AI Response Time**: <100ms per decision
- **Q-Value Range**: -10 to +20 (higher = more confident)

### AI Learning Indicators
